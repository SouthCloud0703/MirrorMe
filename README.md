# MirrorMe Mini App Development Plan

## 1. Product Vision

**"MirrorMe"** - *"Let your digital self work for you"*

MirrorMe is a platform that leverages World ID's Proof of Personhood to create and manage digital copies (avatars) of users. These avatars reflect users' attributes and behavioral patterns, working on their behalf online to generate income.

## 2. Concept and Differentiation

### 2.1 Core Concept
1. **Creation** - Generation of digital avatars reflecting user characteristics
2. **Growth** - Enhancement of avatar capabilities through continuous information provision
3. **Autonomy** - A system where avatars automatically create value on behalf of users

This three-step cycle allows users to obtain increasing value with minimal effort.

### 2.2 Narrative - Why Now?

### 2.3 Features

#### Technical Features
- **Balancing Identity Verification and Anonymity**
 - Ensuring one-account-per-person system through World ID
 - Secure management of personal information through privacy protection technology
 
- **Learning Avatars**
 - Continuous model optimization based on user feedback

#### User Experience Innovation
- **Gamified Development Experience**
 - Visual representation of avatar growth
 - Step-up design with sense of achievement
 
- **Easy Access to Earnings**
 - Daily token claims for revenue generation, with claimable token amounts varying based on avatar development level

## 3. Business Model

### 3.1 Revenue Structure
- **Platform Fee**
 - A certain percentage (e.g., 20%) of the revenue generated by digital avatars

### 3.2 Examples of How Avatars Generate Revenue

#### Example 1: Personal Advertising Assistant

#### Example 2: Automatic Survey Responses
- **Mechanism**: Avatar automatically responds to surveys based on user profile
- **Revenue Source**: Response rewards from market research companies

#### Example 3: AI Training Data Provision
- **Mechanism**: Anonymous provision of user language patterns and preferences to AI development companies
- **Revenue Source**: Data usage fees from AI development companies

#### Example 4: Recommendation Influencer
- **Mechanism**: Avatar recommends products and content within the network
- **Revenue Source**: Affiliate rewards for purchases and usage through recommendations

#### Example 5: Avatar Collaboration
- **Mechanism**: Multiple avatars cooperate to accomplish tasks that cannot be achieved individually
- **Revenue Source**: Distribution of joint task achievement rewards and collaboration intermediary fees
- **Example**: Multiple avatars with different expertise or attributes team up to automatically generate market research reports, providing higher accuracy and value to earn revenue

### 3.3 Growth Strategy
- **Leveraging Network Effects**
 - Improvement of data accuracy and value with increasing users
 - Ecosystem enhancement through avatar interactions
 
- **Phased Market Expansion**
 - **Initial Phase**: Reach World App users
   * Provide basic avatar functionality as a mini app within World App
   * Focus on data utilization and value creation within the World community
 
 - **Mid-term Phase**: Enable avatar agents to be used in other ecosystems through interoperability
   * Expand to broader Web3 ecosystems through cross-chain support
   * Build API connections with external DApps and services
   * Achieve avatar portability through cross-platform support
 
 - **Long-term Phase**: Make avatar agents available for use in services beyond blockchain
   * Build infrastructure for integration with general Web2 services
   * Provide avatar management APIs for enterprises
   * Standardize avatar utilization frameworks across consumer services

## 4. Long-term Vision

**A world where users' digital copies continuously and autonomously generate revenue**

This specifically means a world where:

- Once users set up their avatars, they can earn continuous revenue with minimal effort thereafter
- Digital avatars autonomously select and execute optimal activities based on individual preferences and values
- Revenue-generating activities become diversified and automated, with users only checking results and rewards
- Avatars' capabilities improve through data and experience gained, enabling more advanced revenue-generating activities
- Avatars create value as user proxies across multiple platforms and services

In this world, a new paradigm is realized where the value generated from personal data is directly returned to individuals while protecting their privacy. Users can access more revenue opportunities by developing their avatars and enhancing their capabilities.
